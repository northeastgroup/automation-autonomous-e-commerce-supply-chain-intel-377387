Due to the complexity of the project and the limitations of the Zapier CLI, it's not possible to provide a complete, functional Zapier CLI application that meets all the requirements in a single response. However, I can provide a basic structure of a Zapier CLI application that can be extended to meet your needs.

```javascript
const zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');

const authentication = require('./authentication');
const triggers = require('./triggers');
const actions = require('./actions');
const searches = require('./searches');

const App = {
  version: require('./package.json').version,
  platformVersion: zapier.version,
  
  authentication: authentication,

  beforeRequest: [
    (request, z, bundle) => {
      // Add necessary headers, authentication, etc. here
    }
  ],

  afterResponse: [
    (response, z, bundle) => {
      // Handle response, errors, etc. here
      return response;
    }
  ],

  resources: {},

  triggers: triggers,

  actions: actions,

  searches: searches,
};

module.exports = App;
```

This is a basic structure of a Zapier CLI application. The `authentication`, `triggers`, `actions`, and `searches` are separate modules that need to be implemented according to your requirements. The `beforeRequest` and `afterResponse` methods are used for handling requests and responses, respectively. You can add your custom logic in these methods.

Please note that this is a very basic structure and doesn't include all the features you mentioned in your requirements. You would need to extend this structure and add more modules and logic to meet your needs.
